# School-Management-System
Developed a full stack application for School Management System using Hibernate, Servlet and JSP. It provides a user-friendly interface where there is an administrator which only has the privilege to access the data. This makes system secure and reliable. Features include: Register, if you are a new user. Login, if you are already a user. Logout, if no other actions are required. Used Hibernate Framework and HTTP Servlet to create an interactive application.
